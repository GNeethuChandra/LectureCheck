Welcome everyone. Today we will discuss an exciting initiative to enhance learning at Dune University through automated lecture recording and content analysis. These are the members of our project and this is our problem statement. Our goal is to ensure that all lectures are accessible to students at any time and anywhere, while also maintaining high standards of quantum quality and alignment. This is the process of our project so lectures professors will record and report lectures to their learning management system where each lecture is accompanied with PDF. The system validates video content for topic wise coverage and match with the PDF analysis. Results are given in the form of grams and percentages. These are the objectives of a project. So our primary objectives are to record and upload lectures for on demand access. And here recording process is already manual features for our project has to do uploading and the rest of the things validate media content for topic wise coverage, match video content with corresponding media files, provide comprehensive analysis and insights on lecture materials. So these are the primary objectives of our project. So this is the technical stack which we will be using for our project. We have already made use of moL, so we are we have chosen the Mat LLM for our project as it is suitable for our requirements and we are still working on it. And this is the workflow of our project. So here is a high level overview of our system architecture. It consists of four main parts, content validation, content matching and no before all this. So we have a lecture recording and uploading, content validation.
