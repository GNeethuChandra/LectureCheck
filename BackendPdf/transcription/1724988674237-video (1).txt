Good morning ma'am. This is Neetu Chandra from Lectures check project. Our problem statement states that dean University would like all their professors to record the lectures and upload them to their learning management system so that the lectures are available for students to watch at any time. With each video there will be a PDF, two uploaded. The system needs to validate the video for topic wise coverage. It also needs to match the video content with PDF and show its analysis. Here's the process. First of all, professors will record and upload lectures to the learning management system where each lecture is attached with a PDF. The system needs to validate the video content for topic wise coverage and match with the PDF analysis. Results are presented as percentages and graphs. Here are the objectives. First of all, topic wise validation of videos matching content with PDF's provide clear analysis offered accessible insights for improvement. Here's the technical stack we'll be using Myrn and LLM. Here's the workflow. So first thing that we'll be doing is lecture recording and uploading. Next thing is content processing and topic extraction, analysis and reporting, topic validation and feedback and iteration. Thank you.
